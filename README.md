# Skillenza_Data_Semantics_Challenge
My participation in Data semantics competition organized at Skliienza.com

The competition was competed by 99 participants and I was 3rd :)

The challenge involved predicting whether a review would be positive or negative depending on the content of the review posted by users in an ecommerce site.

The metric used for scoring was accuracy and I ended up with an accuracy of 81.25%.
